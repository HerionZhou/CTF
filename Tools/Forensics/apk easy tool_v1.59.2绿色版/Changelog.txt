APK Easy Tool v1.59 (2021-03-16)

- Fixed decompile, compile and signing that does nothing for no reason
- No longer show error message due to peoples reporing me useless screenshot

APK Easy Tool v1.58 (2020-12-03)

Note:
- The tool has become a bit too advanced so we remove some features to keep it simple and to proper maintaining
- As of apktool.jar 2.5.0, 32 bit support is deprecated. Once 32 bit support is removed from apktool, APK Easy Tool will also have 32 bit support removed. 32 bit is dead now

Changelog:
- Updated apktool.jar to 2.5.0
- Language improvements
- Updated adb, zipalign, aapt, apksigner from Android SDK 30.0.2
- Logs and history now stored in temp folder C:\Users\(username)\AppData\Local\Temp\AET. They should be stored temporary, not permanently. You can also use any disk cleaner to clear your temp folder which also clears APK Easy Tool's icon cache, logs and history
- Added signature signing options. v4 signing disabled by default so it doesn't create useless .idsig file
- "Only disassemble the main dex classes" is on by default due to annoying smali_assets/assets.dex error on some APKs
in the root. [v2.4.1+]
- Switched back to aapt 1 due to some issues getting APK info
- Default heap is 2048m
- Fix icon loading for decompiled APK
- Fix framework installation path
- Temporary disabled CMD mode, may be removed in next updated. New way to execute CMD is being improved. 
- For more privacy, logs will only save if an error occured. You can still clear the log anytime
- Portable Java path has changed. Select java.exe instead the bin folder
- You can press ESC to cancel which would kill process of java.exe, adb.exe, zipalign.exe and 7z.exe. This is not recommended to do
- Added status bar. It's easier to work with it than custom yellow notice bar
- Removed log date. I don't think anyone will ever look back of their logs
- Removed log level
- Removed replace spaces with underscore. You can use PowerToys which has PowerRename that does the job
- Removed signapk.jar since it's too old and slow
- Removed ZIP signing since not many using this much. APK Easy Tool should be more focused on APK. Please use an alternative tool for ZIP signing https://forum.xda-developers.com/android/software-hacking/tool-zip-builder-v4-2-1-build-sign-t3739556
- Removed quick options because the UI looking bit awkward. It should be simple and more space for multi-languages
- Removed disable tooltip checkbox. Now it is always shown
