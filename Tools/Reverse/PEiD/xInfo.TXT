; xInfo v1.01 By BoB, based on an idea by Haggar
; 
; Use in same way as UserDB.TXT, but use Info= instead of signature=  .. EG:
; [Upx-Lock]
; Info=Protector for Upx..  -> http://www.Team-X.ru
; 
; It works with partial matches, so putting Upx will be same info for all detected files
; with Upx in the name, so put EG Upx-Lock before Upx, or better to put exact string from PEiD ..
; Also, name is not case-sensitive, and it works fine with external detections .. 
; The " *" added by PEiD to external detections is ignored, so don't put in name.
